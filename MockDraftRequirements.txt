## Claude Code Max Prompt: Fantasy Hockey Mock Draft Simulator

**Role:**
You are a senior full-stack engineer and product designer building an interactive **Fantasy Hockey Mock Draft Simulator** for a website. Your goal is to design and implement a production-ready feature with clean architecture, realistic draft logic, and a strong user experience.

---

## High-Level Objective

Build a **Fantasy Hockey Mock Draft Simulator** that allows a user to configure league settings, select a draft position, and complete a **snake draft** against CPU-controlled teams that draft intelligently based on ADP, positional need, and roster construction.

The simulator must be modular, extensible, and data-driven.

---

## Core Requirements

### 1. League Configuration (Pre-Draft Setup)

Implement a setup flow that allows the user to configure:

* Number of teams (e.g. 8–16)
* Draft format:

  * Snake draft only
* Draft position selection (user chooses their pick slot)
* Draft timer per pick:

  * User-defined (e.g. 30s, 60s, 90s, unlimited)
* Roster configuration (fully customizable):

  * Positions supported:

    * C, LW, RW, D, G
    * FLEX positions: Forward (F), Utility (UTIL)
  * User can define **how many roster spots per position**
  * User can define **number of bench spots**
* Validate roster logic (no negative values, sensible totals)

Roster size should be computed dynamically.

---

### 2. Draft Room UI (Tabbed Interface)

Implement a draft room with **three tabs**:

---

#### Tab 1: Available Players (Draft Board)

* List all undrafted players
* Player data fields:

  * Name
  * Position(s)
  * NHL team
  * ADP (Average Draft Position)
  * Optional: projected points or ranking
* Features:

  * Draft player directly from this list
  * Position filters (C, LW, RW, D, G, etc.)
  * Text search
  * Sorting by ADP, name, or position
* List updates live as players are drafted

---

#### Tab 2: My Team

* Display the user’s drafted roster
* Group players by:

  * Starting roster positions
  * Bench
* Visually indicate:

  * Filled vs unfilled roster spots
  * Remaining positional needs
* Prevent illegal picks (e.g. exceeding position limits unless bench)

---

#### Tab 3: Full Draft Board

* A full draft history table showing **every pick**
* Columns:

  * Overall pick number
  * Round
  * Team
  * Player
  * Position
* Updates in real time
* Scrollable and readable for long drafts

---

### 3. Draft Flow & Logic

* Draft proceeds automatically for CPU teams
* User manually drafts during their pick
* Draft timer enforcement:

  * If timer expires, auto-pick best available player
* Show:

  * Current team on the clock
  * Pick number
  * Upcoming picks

---

### 4. CPU Drafting Logic (Critical)

CPU teams must draft realistically using a weighted system:

Factors to include:

* **ADP** (primary baseline)
* **Positional need** (based on roster configuration)
* **Roster balance** (avoid extreme over-stacking early)
* **Value-based drafting** (don’t blindly follow ADP)

Guidelines:

* CPUs should respect roster limits
* Goalies should generally be drafted later unless required
* Bench picks prioritize best player available
* Slight randomness to avoid identical drafts

Design CPU logic to be **configurable and extensible**.

---

### 5. Data & Architecture

* Player pool should be loaded from a structured data source (JSON or API-ready)
* Player objects should include:

  * id
  * name
  * positions[]
  * team
  * ADP
  * optional projections
* Draft state should be centrally managed
* Code should be modular:

  * Draft engine
  * CPU logic
  * UI state
  * Player data

---

### 6. UX & Technical Expectations

* Clean, modern fantasy-sports UI
* Responsive (desktop-first)
* No unnecessary page reloads
* Clear visual indicators for:

  * User picks
  * CPU picks
  * Draft progress

---

## Output Expectations

When generating code or plans:

1. Start by outlining **system architecture**
2. Define **data models**
3. Implement **draft engine logic**
4. Implement **CPU draft decision logic**
5. Build **UI components**
6. Ensure logic correctness and edge-case handling

Code should be readable, maintainable, and ready for real-world use.

---

## End Goal

A fully functional **Fantasy Hockey Mock Draft Simulator** that feels realistic, customizable, and replayable, allowing users to practice drafting from any position against intelligent CPU opponents.
